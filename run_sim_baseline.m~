% This script is to simulate the total profit and overstay duration of the
% operation of EV charging station without tariff & optimal charging
% controller. The simulation result (without controller) is used as a 
% baseline which will be compared to the simulation result with controller.

%% Config
isFixedEventsSequence = true;    
% true -- simulation with infinite number of poles, with fixed sequence of
%         events. This case, the baseline is a constant value.
% false -- simulation with constrained number of poles, with random
%         sequence of events. This case, the baseline has a distribution of
%         values (each value per sequence).
