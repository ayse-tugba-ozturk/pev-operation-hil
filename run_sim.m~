% This script is to simulate EV charging station operations where the
% charging tariff is determined real-time with taking account into EV
% drivers' behaviors. The overall objective of the tariff control is to
% minimize the operation cost of the system operater. 
%
% There are three choices that each EV driver can make at arrival:
% (i) charging with flexibility, (ii) charging as soon as possible, and
% (iii) leaving without charging.
%
% At each arrival of EV driver, user specific parameters, e.g., battery
% capacity, desired parking durations, initial SOC, and needed SOC level
% (for next mobility demand) are randomly sampled from an empirical
% probability distribution function that is generated with TELD dataset 
% [X].
